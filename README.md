# Remotions

## Introduction

The goal of this plugin is allow to repeat moves with the `,` and `;` keys

It is particularly useful for double key moves likes next/previous method: `[m`/`]m`.

The repetition keys can be configured as to be done in the direction of:
- the initial move
- the document

e.g. for `[m` move:

If in the direction of the initial move as been selected then:
- `;` will do `[m` and `,` will do `]m`

If in the direction of the initial move as been selected then:
- `;` will do `]m` and `,` will do `[m`
